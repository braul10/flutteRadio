## Try it out

Inside the `generated` folder there's a compiled APK file that you can install on your Android device.

### Building the Project

If you want to compile the project, please note that it is configured to sign the APK based on a `key.properties` file (located in the `android` folder) referencing a `.jks` file. Additionally, a `local.properties` file is needed to indicate the paths to the Android and Flutter SDKs.
